# ComputerNetworksHandbook
A Book for Newbie Web Developers

## Introduction
For a Web Developer, a basic knowledge of Internet is truly crucial. I am one of the Newbies in the Web development world but really want to consolidate the basic concept of the Internet World in my mind. 

The propose of this project is to start a online reading group for Networks knowledge. No matter how you are familiar with Internet knowledge. You are always welcome to become one of the project contributors.

I use a textbook named ["Computer Networks: A System Approach (5th)"](http://books.google.com.tw/books/about/Computer_Networks.html?id=BvaFreun1W8C&redir_esc=y). I make a lot of notes from this great textbook. If there are some mistakes or ambiguous parts, please let me know and correct it together.

If you likes this project. Please follow me or star it :). It is a kind of encourage to make a high quality material.
